Not chasing iconic objects, but wandering, studying, examining, enjoying. This is the most beautiful place on earth! And I want to make this place even better for tourists and city residents. Minsk is the capital of Belarus, many tourists come here, so it is a good place to start your own business. "

To have a high traffic of people, they learned about the new establishment faster. Before starting to create your own business, you should explore lots of different aspects to make the most profitable business in your city. For example, imagine that you would like to create your own little coffee shop in your city. And one of the first question that you will ask yourself is: \"What is the most suitable place for my little coffee shop?\". And this little task of data analize will help you to answer that question."

This can be done using the Foursquare API and keywords like coffee. Secondly, we need to determine the movement of the population in these places in order to make a graph of the congestion of these places. We can determine this by looking at the amount of tips, such as counting, other types of counting, or perhaps a weighted combination of these. We will manipulate location data as well as venue data, which also includes trends. Finally, once we have this data, we will use weighted traffic scores and average ratings to determine the potentially best places for visitors. "
