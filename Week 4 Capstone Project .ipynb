Not chasing iconic objects, but wandering, studying, examining, enjoying. This is the most beautiful place on earth! And I want to make this place even better for tourists and city residents. Minsk is the capital of Belarus, many tourists come here, so it would be great to have an application in which you can see different places in Minsk, their workload at the moment, reviews of other visitors."

In CH&CH, you can view the lists of your favorite establishments with a workload indicator and choose the least busy at the moment, but your favorite and go to rest there.\nIf all your favorite places are busy, CH&CH will suggest a list of places to visit that you will probably like and which are the least busy at the moment based on your favorite places."

This can be done using the Foursquare API and keywords like meat, dinner, coffee, etc.\nSecondly, we need to determine the movement of the population in these places in order to make a graph of the congestion of these places. We can determine this by looking at the amount of tips, such as counting, other types of counting, or perhaps a weighted combination of these. We will manipulate location data as well as venue data, which also includes trends.\nFinally, once we have this data, we will use weighted traffic scores and average ratings to determine the potentially best places for visitors. Using recommendation systems, we can recommend similar places to visitors. Content-based systems try to figure out what a user's favorite aspects of an item are, and then make recommendations on items that share those aspects.\nCollaborative filtering techniques find similar groups of users, and provide recommendations based on similar tastes within that group.
